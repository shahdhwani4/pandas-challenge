## Cohesive written Analysis:

# Summary:
This report analyzes the performance of fifteen schools across various metrics including average math score, average reading score, and overall passing rates. It identifies the top five performing schools and the bottom five performing schools based on overall passing rates. Additionally, it categorizes schools by size (small, medium, and large) based on student enrollment.

- The total number of students across all schools is 39,170.
- The total budget allocated to all schools is $24,649,428.
- The average math score across all schools is approximately 78.99.
- The average reading score across all schools is approximately 81.88.
- The percentage of students passing math across all schools is about 74.98%.
- The percentage of students passing reading across all schools is about 85.81%.
- The overall passing rate (students passing both math and reading) across all schools is about 65.17%.

**Analysis and Comparisons:**
- Impact of School Type on Academic Performance:
    Charter schools consistently outperform District schools in both math and reading scores as well as overall passing rates. This trend suggests that Charter school management structures or curriculum approaches   may contribute positively to student outcomes.
- Budget Allocation and Student Performance:
	While budget allocation per student varies widely among schools, there is no linear relationship between higher budgets and better academic performance. This indicates that effective resource utilization and educational strategies play crucial roles in achieving higher student success rates.
- Size of  School :
	There is no clear correlation between school size and overall passing rates. High performing schools come in all sizes (small, medium, and large).
- Top vs Bottom Performers: 
	 There is a significant achievement gap between the top and bottom performing schools. The top five schools have an overall passing rate exceeding 90%, while the bottom five schools have an overall passing rate below 54%. This highlights the need to address the factors contributing to the lower performance in some schools.
